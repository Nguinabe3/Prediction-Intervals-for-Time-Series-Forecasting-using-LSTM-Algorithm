# Prediction Intervals for Time Series Forecasting using LSTM-Algorithm

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) architectures which are linear models have been successfully applied in time series analysis forecasting tasks. However, over recent years, the use
of Artificial Neural Networks to tackle the same task is gradually capturing the attention of the research community. Especially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which are able to model non-linear dependencies between time series have offered promising results. A special type of RNN which is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been designed the improve on the Vanilla RNN by enforcing the long-term learning behavior when given the data and simulating the behavior of randomly generated data
over time, through complex units with varied components. In this work, we implemented and compared different methods such as ARIMA, Simple RNN, LSTM on real-world climate data. Using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an evaluation metric, we showed that LSTM is able to improve the forecast of ARIMA by a factor of 6. We then propose a new training approach that combines and make the best use of LSTM through bootstraps sampling and prediction intervals. The results obtained with both configuration improved the LSTM forecast by a factor of 5 for instance for the bootstrap strategy
